Using this python code, I test 10 randomly selected users to calculate the average RMSE for each algorithm of three and test on user based and item based.For used based test, changing the code, switching to the getRecommendations() method.For item based test, changing the code, switching to the getRecommendedItems() method. And used based or item based, do the following changes:
  For distance algorithm, switch one input similarity parameter to sim_distance  For cosine algorithm, switch one input similarity parameter to sim_cosine.  For pearson algorithm, switch one input similarity parameter to sim_pearson.   After changing the code for each algorithm, run the code in command line:$ python rec.pyIn addition, the data required by my code is in the folder named data which contains 100K movielens data.
